This project **Login Form in File Handling** is a implementation of files concept, written in Python. The package 'Tkinter' is used to make this into an GUI. 

This project aims at three tasks, viz.,
1. Registration
2. Login/Logout
3. Retrieve Password

**Registration:** When the user chose registration, the program gets email address and password in the registration form and validate and write(append) the credentials in a text file if they're a valid one. Else, the program throws an error message.

**Login/Logout:** This functionality gets credentials from the user and match it with the pre-saved values. The user will be logged in if the credentials match. 

**Retrieve Password:** This operation gets the email address from the user and helps to retrieve the password.
